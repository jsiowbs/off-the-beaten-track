# Off The Beaten Track
TechUp 2024 - Travel Recommender Web App

Problem statement: Travelling is universal - an opportunity to explore the world and enrich our lives with new experiences and perspectives, or simply to enjoy a well-deserved break. However, amidst the vast array of destinations, we often get overwhelmed when deciding where to venture next. Thereâ€™s just too many places to visit and too little time to do so. While most travel websites offer suggestions and lists, they often lack the personalization needed to cater to individual preferences, such as budget, traveller type, language, and climate.  Navigating through this sea of choices can be discouraging and time-consuming. Does this always have to be the case?

Proposed Solution: Introducing a web app to alleviate the burdens of travel planning by offering personalized recommendations based on user-defined parameters - inspiring new travel destinations, saving time, and reducing the initial stressors/barriers associated with travel planning.
