TechUp 2024 - Travel Recommender Web App

Problem statement: "Traveling is universal - a means of exploring the world and enriching our lives with new experiences and perspectives (or sometimes just enjoy a good break). Yet we often find ourselves at a loss when it comes to deciding where to go next. There’s too many places to visit and too little time to do so. While most travel websites offer suggestions and lists, they often lack the personalization necessary to meet our individual preferences, such as budget, travelling preference, language and climate.  Finding the right place to travel shouldn’t be this hard!

Proposed Solution:
Web app that recommends travel destinations based on user-defined parameters - inspiring new travel destinations, saving time and reducing the initial stressors/barriers associated with travel planning.
